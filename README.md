<h1 align="center">Issues :</h1>  
<p> <span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); "> 1.Maze Generation </span> - The algorithm occasionally creates disconnected sections, though the path is guaranteed to exist due to hardcoded routes. <br>- Mazes might lack complexity, especially in harder difficulties, where more intricate paths are expected.</p>
<p> <span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); ">
2.  Player Movement</span>- The collision detection system for walls is basic and sometimes leads to unexpected player position adjustments. <br>- The player's movement feels clunky at times, particularly when near the maze boundaries. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); ">
3. Game Design</span> - The overall design is minimalistic and lacks polish. <br> - Visual elements, such as the house at the maze's exit, could benefit from more detailed and animated graphics<br> - The menu design, while functional, does not scale well with higher resolutions
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; color :rgb(127, 71, 169); ">
4.  Performance</span>On larger maze sizes (e.g., Hard difficulty), there may be occasional lag when redrawing the maze.

<h1 align="center">Future Improvements :</h1>  
<br>
  - Maze Generation: - Replace the current generation algorithm with a more robust one (e.g., Primâ€™s algorithm) to ensure better structure and variety. - Add randomized obstacles or dead ends to increase the challenge. 
  <br> <br>
  - Player Mechanics: - Improve collision handling to provide smoother movement. - Introduce animations for player movement and transitions between maze levels.
  <br><br>
  - Graphical Design: - Add textures, lighting effects, and animated elements to enhance the visual appeal. - Create dynamic themes for each difficulty level.
<br><br>
  - Game Features: - Include additional gameplay mechanics, such as collectibles, traps, or timed challenges. - Implement sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience. - Add a leaderboard to track the best completion times.
